# Crime Rate Analysis

## Description

This project aims to analyze crime rate data to identify patterns, trends, and predictions. The dataset contains crime reports from various locations, including information such as crime type, date, and location. Using this dataset, the project performs data cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling to help understand the factors influencing crime rates and forecast future occurrences.

## Data Source

The dataset contains crime reports with the following columns:

- **Date**: Date of the reported crime.
- **Crime Type**: The category or type of crime (e.g., theft, assault, burglary).
- **Location**: Geographical location of the crime.
- **Arrests**: Indicator if the crime led to an arrest.
- **Description**: Further details about the crime.

## Features

- **Crime data cleaning and preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering.
- **Visualizing crime trends and hot spots**: Generate insightful visualizations such as crime type distribution, crime frequency by location, trends over time, and geographical heatmaps.
- **Predictive analysis for crime rates using machine learning models**: Apply machine learning techniques like linear regression, decision trees, or random forests to forecast future crime rates and identify high-risk areas.
